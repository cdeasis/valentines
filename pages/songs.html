            <p class="intro">
                You mentioned how you wanted to learn more about me, and I shared <em>Instant Crush</em>, a song that I love and listen to often, especially when I'm relaxing. I love music, and I'm almost always listening to something, especially when I'm driving. I listen to a wide range of genres, but here's some more of my favorite songs, and a little bit of why they matter to me.
            </p>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Titanium (David Guetta ft. Sia)</em></h2>
            <p>
                This song became my anthem in college. I think one night I got drunk and sang it loudly, putting in a lot of effort to hit all the high notes, and my friends loved it and from that point would play it eveyr time we partied or hung out. When I hear it now, I associate it with all the great and fun memories I have with my college friends, people I don't see as often anymore because of work or distance, but who still mean a lot to me.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Clarity (Zedd ft. Foxes)</em></h2>
            <p>
                This song is euphoric to me and fills me with pure bliss. This is one of my favorite songs to hear on a night out with my friends and it makes me reminisce about being younger, back in high school and college, with everything felt a little simpler and more carefree.
            </p>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Smooth (Carlos Santana ft. Rob Thomas)</em></h2>
            <p>
                This song is very special to me, my dad absolutely loved it. When he and my mother were dating, he would sing this to her all the time, especially when he would drive her around. When I was younger, he and I would sing it together in the car, too, and every time I hear this song now, it fills me with happiness.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Bésame Mucho (Andrea Bocelli version)</em></h2>
            <p>
                A slow and much smoother song. This one has a lot of significance to me. My grandparents used to dance to this song, and this was another one my dad would sing to my mom. I love singing along with this song, too, as even though it's in Spanish, it's easy to follow along, and the lower vocal range is easier on my voice hahaha.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Mirrors (Justin Timberlake)</em></h2>
            <p>
                To me, this song is as close to perfection that's achievable in our imperfect world. The entire song feels ethereal and beautiful, from the instrumental to the emotion behind it. Every time I hear it, it hits the same way, and almost makes me want to just drop my head back, close my eyes, and feel the bliss.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Stereo Love (Edward Maya ft. Vika Jigulina)</em></h2>
            <p>
                This song is easily in my top 3-5 favorites ever. Similar to <em>Mirrors</em>, I think it's just incredibly beautiful. The melody and the vocals pull me in, and when the beat drops, I feel like I'm somewhere else for a few minutes. To me, it's the perfect escape.
            </p>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Just Dance (Lady Gaga ft. Colby O'Donis)</em></h2>
            <p>
                There are times where I want songs that'll get me more hyped up, and <em>Just Dance</em> is certainly one of them. The high tempo beat and the catchy lyrics are so fun to bob my head to and sing along with, it just all feels so blissfull and carefree.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>L'amour Toujours (Gigi D'Agostino, multiple versions)</em></h2>
            <p>
                There are multiple versions of this song, but they're all very good in their own way. Similar to <em>Just Dance</em>, to me it feels blissful and carefree, like I can let go of whatever's bothering me for that moment and just sink myself into the rhythm and melody.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Eternally Yours (Motionless in White)</em></h2>
            <p>
                Many of the songs I've listed here are mainly pop or alternative songs, but another genre I like is metal and metal core. This song isn't on the heavier side, but it still has those metal elements. THe chours is extremely powerful to me, and this song became a powerful crtuch for me a few years ago when I was going through a rough time in my life. It still holds a special place in my heart to this day.

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>I Wanna be Yours (Arctic Monkeys)</em></h2>
            <p>
                At the end of high school and beginning of college, I had a big Arctic Monkeys phase. I still like a lot of their songs, but this one is probably my favorite because of the slow rhythm and the addictive feeling I get by the vocals.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>My Way (Frank Sinatra)</em></h2>
            <p>
                This is one of my favorite songs to sing. My dad loved it, and we used to sing this a lot when I was growing up as well. It's one of those songs that feels powerful and personal, and I've always felt connected to it.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Smells like Teen Spirit (Nirvana)</em></h2>
            <p>
                This is a song that does get me hype, and is a little bit on the heavier side. A thing I've found about myself is that I'm drawn to songs with a great guitar solo or melody in it, and the solo in this song is cathartic to me, like releasing energy that's been building up.
            </p>
            </section>

            <section class="song">
            <h2><em>Sweet Child O' Mine (Guns N' Roses)</em></h2>
            <p>
                This song was the one that got me into rock and eventually metal. I was immediately drawn to the guitar riff and solo, there was just something about it that just stuck with me. Even though it's not necessarily my favorite rock song now, it's still important to me because it opened the door to an entire genre music that I ended up loving.
