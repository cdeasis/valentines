                    Hi Lvy 😊
                </p>

                <p>
                    I know we haven't talked much in the past few weeks. I have been busy myself, with life, work, and friends. But I still want to do this for you because you matter so much to me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We met at an unexpected time in my life, and I have come to know the warm, caring, gentle, smart, thoughtful woman you are and I wanted to show my appreciation for knowing you and what we share.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What started out from a just an in game connection blossomed into something very real and heartfelt to me. The way you nurtured and guided me in the game, your incredible patience and the care you showed really meant a lot to me. I naturally wanted to know more about you, so I began asking you things outside of the game, and the more I learned about you, your values, your jokes, your quirks and the way you'd speak and show yourself off too, the more I began to like you and fall for you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That week in December when you told me that you missed me, and that you panic when you don't see me online really hit me. I know that I haven't been on much since then - I'm just a little lost inside the game I think. Playing without you just isn't the same for me. I was really touched and I was so happy when you wanted to know more about me, my lifestyle, my preferences, my friends, my intentions with you. That's the sort of care and curiosity that makes you special to me. When you asked about my intentions, what I said was true, and they still are. I don't fall often, but when I do I fall hard, and for one person only, and that person is you. You feel like home to me, and in the same way you said I make you feel at ease, you do the same for me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And I know what happened after, I still think about it, and again I'm sorry for my role in that. I never want to hurt you, never back then, and never now. Just know that I acknowledge everything you said that day, and wish I can go back in time and make everything okay again. The differences we have are there, but from my perspective, everyone has their differences, and I am willing and want to work with you to bridge the gaps we have, if that's something you want too, and that is something I should have communicated with you in the moment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I know this may be a lot, or this may overwhelm you. I'm sorry if that is the case. Please don't take any of this the wrong way. On this special day I thought I should send you a little something. I just want you to know one last thing: all those times when I've said I'm not leaving or going anywhere - I mean that. Until there's the day you tell me to my face you can't stand me, or tell me to leave, or tell me to buzz off, I will always be here for you, because in my eyes, you're worth loving and waiting for, and I want you by my side.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Happy Valentine's Day Lvy. I hope everything's doing well on your end. I love you and you will hold a special place in my heart in this lifetime and in every lifetime. You are an amazing person and you mean the world to me. I do not know where I currently stand with you, and that is okay. I do not want to rush you, I just want you to take this gift as a token of my appreciation for what you mean to me. Writing, making, and sending all of this is very important to me, to express to you how I really feel. Thank you, I am so incredibly lucky to have met you and to have you in my life. 🤍
