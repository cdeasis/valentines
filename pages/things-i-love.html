            <p class="intro">
                There are so many things I love about you, some big, some small, and some you may not even realize. These are just a few of them.
            </p>

            <section class="love-item">
                <h2>Your Kindness</h2>
                <p>
                    From the very beginning, you were very kind to me. You cared a lot to make me comfortable around you, both as a person and in-game, and that really meant a lot to me.
                </p>

                <h2>Your Patience</h2>
                <p>
                    You are incredibly patient. You waited for me to get stronger in game, but outside of it, you always waited for me to come home, for example, when I was out with my friends. I cannot tell you how much I appreicate that, to have someone care that much about me really touched my heart.
                </p>

                <h2>Your Care and Support</h2>
                <p>
                    Inside the game, you were there to help me since the very beginning, making sure I'm growing and getting stronger, and protecting me when things went wrong. Outside of the game, you were there to listen to me when some things weren't going well, and you were also there to celebrate when things did go well. For that, I cannot thank you enough.
                </p>

                <h2>The Way You Prepare and Think</h2>
                <p>
                    You are very thoughtful and prepared. You always have a plan for something, and you carefully think through things, and that is something I really admire about you. 
                </p>

                <h2>Your Efficiency</h2>
                <p>
                    You are incredibly efficient. Whether if it's in game and the things you do and buy to make yourself stronger, or outside the game with how hard you work and dedicated you are to your store, it's an amazing quality to have.
                </p>

                <h2>Your Humor and Light Side</h2>
                <p>
                    You have a great sense of humor, and the jokes you make always make me smile and laugh. I also love that you let the lighter side of you shine, and that you can be silly too. I love that about you, and it makes me feel at ease with you.
                </p>

                <h2>Your Curiosity</h2>
                <p>
                    You are very curious, and I love that about you. You ask questions, you want to know more about me, and over time, you shared things about your self. I love being able to learn more about you too, and that I can be safe and open with you to share things about myself, too.
                </p>

                <h2>Your Safety</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout my time knowing you, I have always felt safe with you. I feel like I can truly be myself around you, and that is a very special and important thing for me to have with someone. I hope you know that I feel the same way about you, and that you can be yourself around me too.
