            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul class="fun-facts">

                <li>My birthday is on June 5. I'm also an only child. Growing up, I always wanted a sibling but as I've grown older, I've come to appreciate being an only child.</li>

                <li>I play the piano. I started when I was super young, but recently I haven't played as much. I come from a family of musicians, my dad sings really well, and my mom was my first piano teacher. I have always wanted to learn how to play the guitar, though.</li>

                <li>I love sports. I grew up a swimmer, played basketball in high school, and later volleyball in college. I'm a die hard New York sports fan and used to always watch games, but as life has gotten busier in the past few years, I've watched less, but I do still keep up with them. Baseball is my favorite sport, and the Yankees are my favorite team. Barry Bonds was my favorite player growing up, hence my name on Discord haha. My favorite team outside of New York sports is FC Barcelona.</li>

                <li>When I was younger, my family used to travel a lot, at least once a year. Nowadays, I don't get much of an opportunity to travel anymore, but I'm making more of an effort to travel and explore the world. I want to go back to Spain, as even though I am Filipino, a pretty significant portion of my family does come from Spain, Valencia specifically, so at some point I do want to go and visit.</li>

                <li>Most of the pictures I showed are me going out with my friends and having fun, but I actually prefer nights that are quieter and where I stay in. I like being at home, relaxing, or playing games. I've always loved video games, and my favorite genre are factory simulator or city building games, like <em>Satisfactory</em> or <em>Dyson Sphere Program</em>. The game I have the most hours in though, is <em>League of Legends.</em></li>

                <li>I love driving. I always find a way to make an excuse to go and drive, even though the traffic here in New York is awful haha. Long road tripes are my favorite, and I always offer to drive. Something about it is so calming to me, whether if I'm with friends or if I'm alone. And of course, it's the perfect opportunity to listen to the music that I love.</li>

                <li>I'm a terrible artist, I can't draw nor can I do arts and crafts well at all. Despite this, though, I love museums, especially art museums. I love to just walk around at my own slow pace and observe and appreciate different works, whether it be paintings, sculptures, textiles. To me, it's really calming and for a little bit, I get to be in my own world.</li>

                <li>I really value meaningful connections and getting to know people at a deeper level. I'm also pretty reflective and sentimental. I like to think a lot, and notice small things, and I care deeply about the people in my life.</li>

            </ul>
